Covigent is a desktop app for managing information of quarantined individuals and the tasks to be done by staff of the quarantine facilities. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type fast, Covigent can improve your efficiency in managing your patients and tasks instead of using traditional GUI apps.

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addpatient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addpatient n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/COMMENT]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/Is vegan` or as `n/John Doe`.
