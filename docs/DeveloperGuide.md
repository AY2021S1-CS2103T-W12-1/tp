## 1. Preface

Covigent is a desktop management application that helps to keep track of the information of quarantined individuals and the tasks to be done by the staff of a small hotel that has been converted to a quarantine facility.

The Developer Guide for Covigent v1.4 is designed to illustrate and identify the high level architecture systems used to design and implement the Covigent application. The document contains an overall view of the system hierarchy, logical views of the system components, and a process view of the system’s communication. We hope that this Developer Guide serves you well in understanding and maintaining the Covigent application. 

The link to the GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp).

## 2. Setting Up

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Design

This section describes some noteworthy details on how Covigent is designed.

### 3.1 Architecture: High Level View

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dg/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 1. Architecture diagram of Covigent</i>
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of Covigent. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/plantuml) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-commons-component) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletepatient Alex Yeoh`.

<p align="center">

    <br />
    <i>Figure 3. Sequence diagram of deletepatient alex command</i>
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.


### 3.2 UI Component

The `UI` component displays information for the users based on user's input. The GUI to displayed is based on the return from logic.
It uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of many different parts that inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `MainWindow` is made up of 
* A `PatientListPanel` that displays the list of patients. The layout is defined by `PatientCard` and `PatientDetailsPanel`.
* A `RoomListPanel` that displays the list of rooms. The layout is defined by `RoomCard` and `RoomDetailPanel`.
* A `RoomTaskListPanel` that displays the list of tasks. The layout is defined by `TaskCard`.
* A `HelpWindow` that displays the link to the help page.
* A `CommandBox` that displays the area for command input.
* A `ResultDisplay` that displays the robot response.
* A `StatusBarFooter` that displays the status bar footer.<br>
Below is a class diagram for `Ui`

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` component listens for changes to `Model` data so that the `UI` can be updated with the modified data.
Below shows the interaction with `Model`

### 3.3 Logic Component

The `Logic` component is the "brains" of Covigent. While the `Ui` defines the GUI and `Model` defines in-memory data,
the `Logic` component does most of the heavy-lifting in terms of deciding what to change within the `Model` and what to 
return to the `Ui`.<br>
The diagram below shows the structure of the `Logic` component and how it interacts with its internal parts.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dg/LogicClassDiagram.png">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 6. Structure of the Logic Component</i>
</p>

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. Once a user input is obtained from the GUI, `Logic` uses the `CovigentAppParser` class to parse the users' commands
and return a `Command` object.
1. The `Command` is executed by `LogicManager`.
1. Depending on the command input by the user, it may mutate the `Model`, such as adding a new patient, room or task.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` that is returned to the `Ui`.
1. These `CommandResults` can instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help or error messages to the user.

Shown below is the Sequence Diagram within the `Logic` component for the API call: `execute("deletepatient alex")`.

### 3.4 Model Component

The `Model` API acts as a facade that handles interaction between different kinds of data in Covigent. These data include user's preferences, patient records and room list. The `Model` API exposes the methods that allow the logic component to utilise to perform retrieving and updating of data.

The `Model` component,
  * stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
  * stores a `PatientRecords` object that stores the data of all the patients. 
  * stores a `RoomList` object that stores the data of all the rooms.
  * stores a `RoomTaskRecords` object that stores all the `RoomTaskAssociation` objects, which keep track of the room that a task belongs to.
  * exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>`, `ObservableList<Room>` and `ObservableList<RoomTaskAssociation>` which can be observed. This means that the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when data in the lists changes.
  * does not depend on any of the three components.

The concrete class `ModelManager` implements `Model` interface and manages the data for Covigent. `ModelManager` contains `UserPrefs`, `PatientRecords`, `RoomList` and `RoomTaskRecords`. These classes manage the data related to their specific features.

Below is a class diagram for `ModelManager`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dg/ModelClassDiagram.png">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 7. Class Diagram for Model Component</i>
</p>

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The breakdown for each type of data in `ModelManager`, which include `PatientRecords`, `RoomList` and `RoomTaskRecords`, can be found below.

The `PatientRecords` class is in charge of maintaining the data of the patients and in ensuring the uniqueness of patients according to their names. Below is a class diagram for `PatientRecords`. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dg/PatientRecordsClassDiagram.png">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 8. Class Diagram for PatientRecords</i>
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `PatientRecords` class implements the interface ReadOnlyList&lt;Patient&gt; but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the interface is reflected as simply `ReadOnlyList`.
</div>
<br>

The `RoomList` class is in charge of maintaining the data in the rooms and in ensuring the uniqueness of rooms according to the room numbers. As each room stores the data of the patient who resides in the room and the tasks meant for the room, it incorporates data from both `Patient` and `RoomTasks`. `RoomTasks` class is in charge of maintaining the data of the tasks in a room. The full details of `Patient` can be found in the previous class diagram for `PatientRecords` so it is no longer reflected in the class diagram for `RoomList`. The class diagram for `RoomList` is shown below.  
<p align="center">

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `RoomList` class implements the interface ReadOnlyList &lt;Room&gt; and the `RoomTasks` class implements the interface ReadOnlyList&lt;Task&gt;. However, due to a limitation of PlantUML, the interface is reflected as simply `ReadOnlyList`.
</div>
<br>

The `RoomTaskRecords` class is in charge of maintaining the data regarding the association of a task in a room. The `RoomTaskAssociation` class acts as an association class that ties `Task` and `Room` together so that the `Task` object does not need to know of the details of `Room` and we are still able to identify the room number that `Task` belongs to and its index in `Room`. The class diagram for `RoomTaskRecords` is shown below.

### 3.5 Storage Component

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dg/UML_Storage_Diagram.png">
    <br />
    <i>Figure 11. Structure of the Storage Component</i>
</p>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` API handles the reading and writing of data in Json format, enabling Covigent to remember information stored by user even when the application is closed. The Storage API behaves like a façade by handling the storage classes and interfaces.

The `Storage` interface class diagram is shown below, and as it can be seen it inherits from specific storage interfaces.

The `Storage` component,
  *	Saves `UserPref` objects in Json format 
  *	Reads `UserPred` objects in Json format
  *	Saves `RoomRecords` and `PatientRecords` data in json format 
  *	Reads `RoomRecords` and `PatientRecords` data in json format 

The information of the `Patient` and `Room` feature of Covigent is stored locally in the Json format. This is done by adapting the Patient and Room feature into JsonSerializablePatientRecords and JsonSerializableRoomRecords respectively.

The class diagram for StorageManager is shown below

### 3.6 Commons Component

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how [Patient](#41-patient-feature), [Room](#42-room-feature) and [Task](#43-task-feature) features are implemented.

### 4.1 Patient Feature

#### 4.1.1 Overview

The patient feature in Covigent allows hotel staff to store important information about the individuals that are quarantined in the hotels. Some of these important dynamic information include temperature and comment regarding the patient. To fully understand the patient feature, it is important to learn about the [implementation](#412-implementation) and [design considerations](#413-design-considerations) of the patient object before looking at the possible [commands](#414-create-read-update-delete) that can operate on the patient object. A patient is meant to be allocated to a room in the facility, hence tying the patient feature with the room feature together.

#### 4.1.2 Implementation
A `Patient` object in Covigent contains the following attributes, which is also reflected in Figure 15:
1. Name
1. Temperature
1. PeriodOfStay
1. Age
1. Phone
1. Comment  

Each of the attribute is a stand-alone class on its own.

  <p align="center">
      <img src="images/dg/PatientClassDiagram.png">
      <br />
      <i>Figure 15. Class Diagram for Patient</i>
  </p>

#### 4.1.3 Design Considerations 
**Aspect: Encapsulation of fields for `Patient` object**

* Option 1: Using primitive data types for `Temperature`, `Age` and `Comment` classes

Classes like `Temperature`, `Age` and `Comment` can be easily treated as primitive data types including double and string. However, this option goes against the spirit of OOP. Furthermore, it does not align to the original design of AddressBook3, which Covigent was morphed from, in which `Name` and `Phone` attributes were abstracted out as separate classes. 

* Option 2: Encapsulate constituent patient attributes in their own classes

This option increases OOP and is aligned to the original design of AddressBook3. In addition, this design has proven itself to be extensible in the long run and allows for adjustments to `Patient` attributes easily. For example, when setting the valid temperature range as input for `Temperature`, only the `Temperature` class needs to change, which demonstrates the essence of the single responsibility principle. This allows for better understanding and maintenance of our code base in the future.

**Aspect: Decision on the uniqueness of `Patient` object**

* Option 1: Uniqueness is identified by name, age and phone

Originally, we intended to define two `Patient` to be equals if they have the same `Name`, `Age` and `Phone`. However, such a design will make it difficult for users of Covigent as they will have to key in all these fields when executing `EditPatientCommand` and `DeletePatientCommand` in order for Covigent to uniquely identify the `Patient` to manipulate. 

* Option 2: Uniqueness is identified by name

Keeping in mind the ease of usage of Covigent for users, we chose to identify `Patient` uniquely by `Name` only. As such, when users need to manipulate the data of a `Patient`, all they need to input is the `Name`. Furthermore, we believes that since Covigent is used by small hotels, there is a very low chance of two patients having the same names.

##### Features related to Patient
Having looked at the design of `Patient`, we can now explore the possible features related to `Patient`. In particular, our commands support [create, read, update, delete](#414-create-read-update-delete) and [search](#415-search). 

The features comprise of five commands namely,
* `AddPatientCommand` - Adding patients
* `ListPatientCommand` - Listing all the patients
* `EditPatientCommand` - Editing patients
* `DeletePatientCommand` - Deleting patients
* `SearchPatientCommand`- Searching for patients

_Written by Yun Qing_

#### 4.1.4 Create, Read, Update, Delete
In this section, we will cover the implementation of the manipulation of the `Patient` data. The commands that allow creating, reading, updating and deleting of `Patient` include `AddPatientCommand`, `ListPatientCommand`, `EditPatientCommand` and `DeletePatientCommand`. 

As the `Patient` data are stored in `UniquePatientList`, which ensures the uniqueness of `Patient`, the actual manipulation of the `Patient` data is made in `UniquePatientList` class.

Some of the significant methods within `UniquePatientList` class that allows the manipulation of the `Patient` data are shown below:
* `UniquePatientList#add(Patient toAdd)` - Adds a `Patient` to `UniquePatientList`.
* `UniquePatientList#setPatient(Patient target, Patient editedPatient)` - Edits the attributes of `Patient`.
* `UniquePatientList#remove(Patient toRemove)` - Deletes a `Patient` from `UniquePatientList`.
* `UniquePatientList#asUnmodifiableObservableList()` - Returns an observable list of `Patient`
* `UniquePatientList#getPatientWithName(Name name)` - Returns the `Patient` with the given `Name` if the `Patient` object exists in `UniquePatientList`. Since `Name` is an identifier of a `Patient`, this method is used in `EditPatientCommand` and `DeletePatientCommand` to modify the `Patient` or check if the `Patient` to be deleted exists.

These methods in `UniquePatientList` class support the corresponding methods in the facade classes `PatientRecords` and `ModelManager`. In particular, the `Model` interface exposes the methods `Model#addPatient(Patient patient)`, `Model#setPatient(Patient target, Patient editedPatient)`, `Model#deletePatient(Patient target)`, `Model#getPatientWithName(Name name)` and `Model#getFilteredPatientList()`.

For brevity's sake, we will only illustrate the implementation of 2 specific commands - `AddPatientCommand` and `EditPatientCommand`.

**Implementation of AddPatientCommand**

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations that `AddPatientCommand` performs.

**Step 1.** The user executes `addpatient [input all attributes of Patient]` command to add a patient to Covigent. An `AddPatientCommandParser` object is created and the `AddPatientCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called, which helps to parse the different attributes of `Patient`. The parse method returns a new `AddPatientCommand` object and the `AddPatientCommand` object stores the `Patient` to be added.

**Step 2.** The `Patient` to be added is then searched through `UniquePatientList#internalList`using the `Model#hasPatient(Patient patient)` method to check if the patient already exists. If the patient already exists, a `CommandException` object will be thrown with an error message.

**Step 3.** Through `Model#addPatient(Patient toAdd)`, the `Patient` will be added to `UniquePatientList`.

**Step 4.** A success message with the new patient details will be appended with the `AddPatientCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

The sequence diagram for a successful execution of `AddPatientCommand` can be found below.

</div>
<br>

_Written by Yun Qing_

**Implementation of EditPatientCommand**
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations that `EditPatientCommand` performs.

**Step 1.** The `EditPatientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it checks if the `Name` defined when instantiating
`EditPatientCommand(Name patientToBeEdited, EditPatientDescriptor editPatientDescriptor)` is valid. The `EditPatientDescriptor` holds
the edited information of the `Patient`.

**Step 2.** A new `Patient` with the updated values will be created and the patient is then searched through `UniquePatientList#internalList`
using the `Model#hasPatient(Patient patient)` method to check if the patient already exists. If the patient already exists,
`CommandException` will be thrown with an error message.

**Step 3.** The newly created `Patient` will replace the existing patient object through the `Model#setPatient(Patient target, Patient editedPatient)`
method.

**Step 4.** A success message with the edited patient will be appended with the `EditPatientCommand#MESSAGE_EDIT_PATIENT_SUCCESS` constant. A 
new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

_Written by Ming De_


#### 4.1.5 Search

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations that `SearchPatientCommand` performs.

**Step 1.** The `SearchPatientCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and checks the `criteriaToSearch` via `confirmCriteria(SearchPatientDescriptor searchPatientDescriptor)`. 
The `SearchPatientDescriptor` holds the `name` or `temperatureRange` of the Command.

**Step 2.** If the `criteriaToSearch` is `SearchCriteria.CRITERIA_NOT_FOUND`, `CommandException` will be thrown with an error message.

**Step 3.** If the `criteriaToSearch` is `SearchCriteria.CRITERIA_IS_NAME`, we update the `Model`'s `FilteredPatientList` Predicate via `updateNamePredicate(Model model, SearchPatientDescriptor searchPatientDescriptor)`
Then `findPatientWithName(SearchPatientDescriptor searchPatientDescriptor, List<Patient> patientList)` will go through `Model`'s `FilteredPatientList`, if no patient is found, `CommandException` will be thrown with an error message. If there is at least one patient found, a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

**Step 4.** If the `criteriaToSearch` is `CRITERIA_IS_TEMPERATURE`, we update the `Model`'s `FilteredPatientList` Predicate via `updateTemperaturePredicate(Model model, SearchPatientDescriptor searchPatientDescriptor)`
Then `findPatientWithTemperature(SearchPatientDescriptor searchPatientDescriptor, List<Patient> patientList)` will go through `Model`'s `FilteredPatientList`, if no patient is found, `CommandException` will be thrown with an error message. If there is at least one patient found, a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

**Step 5.** If the `criteriaToSearch` is `TOO_MANY_CRITERIA` A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

### 4.2 Room Feature

#### 4.2.1 Overview
The application is able to track the room details. It keep tracks of the whether a room is occupied and the patient inside the room if it is occupied. 
It also keeps track of the tasks assigned to a specific room. Hence, there is a need to represent the Room List as a list of Rooms on which the application can perform read and update operations.

#### 4.2.2 Implementation

The class diagram for RoomList is shown below.
  <p align="center">
      <img src="images/dg/UML_RoomFeature.png">
      <br />
      <i>Figure 17. Class diagram for RoomList</i>
  </p>
  
From the diagram above, the `RoomList` contains of one `UniqueRoomList`. This `UniqueRoomList` is a wrapper class around the `RoomList`
which contains an ObservableList of `Patient` and PriorityQueue of `Patient`. The `RoomList` can contain from about 1 to 500 rooms.

Each Room contains the following member attributes, all of which are non-nullable attributes:
1. **roomNumber**
This gives the room number of the Room object
2. **isOccupied**
This gives the information of whether the Room is occupied or not. If there is a `Patient` inside the `Room`, then the isOccupied is true, else false
3. **patient**
This gives the patient details and it is stored as an Optional object. If there is no `Patient`, then the Optional.empty() is assigned.
4. **tasks**
This gives all the tasks that are assigned to a specific room. The number of tasks assigned can be zero.

The proposed room feature is facilitated by `RoomList`. It extends `ReadOnlyRoomList` which reads the Room information Json file, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `RoomList#addRooms(int num)` — adds the number of which are said to add together and retains infromation previously stored in each room
* `RoomList#containsRoom(Room toCehck)` - checks whether the given room exists
* `RoomList#clearRoom(Name patientName)` - removes patient from the room
* `RoomList#setSingleRoom(Room target, Room editedRoom)` - sets the editedRoom to the target room

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addRooms(int num)`, `Model#hasroom(Room room)`, `Model#clearRoom(Name patientName)` and `Model#setSingleRoom(Room target, Room editedRoom)` respectivley.

The GUI for room feature is based on a `ListView` that updates whenever the `RoomList` is updated and a `scroll pane` that
displays the details of the room. To ensure that the information displayed in the `scroll pane` is updated dynamically, 
we employ the use of `Listeners` that listens for changes and notify the `scroll pane` to update.

#### 4.2.3 Design Considerations 
**Aspect: Decision on allowing `editRoomCommand` that allows changing of room number to remain**

* Option 1: Do not change the `editRoomCommand`
Allowing the users to change room numbers will give the user more power in customising the rooms. However, this option introduced a bug into the system
that could not be easily resolved unless we changed our entire implementation of `InitRoomCommand`.
    
* Option 2: Remove `editRoomCommand` ability to change room number and rename it to `AllocateRoomCommand`
Removing the `editRoomCommand` to change room number is much more time-efficient compared to changing the entire implementation of `InitRoomCommand`. We
also decided that there should be no reason that a user would need to change the room number. Renaming the method to `AllocateRoomCommand` would provide
more clarity for the method.
    
Ultimately, we decided on Option 2. This is because keeping `editRoomCommand` would lead to a large consumption of time to redesign the system. In order
to not stray from our schedule, we have to remove `editRoomCommand` to ensure that we can develop the other features on time.
Furthermore, to solve the bug that was introduced, we would have to store the count of the number of times `InitRoomCommand` was called. This would
cause us to store information in another `.json` file which is unnecessary. Therefore, we decided that the forgoing a
small function like this would be a better choice.

##### Feature related to Room

The features comprise of five commands namely,
* `InitRoomCommand` - Initializes the number of rooms in Covigent app.
* `ListRoomCommand` - Lists all the rooms in Covigent app.
* `AllocateRoomCommand` - Allocates a patient to a room.
* `SearchRoomCommand` - Searches for the room with the specified room number.
* `FindEmptyRoomCommand` - Finds an empty room with the lowest room number.

We will illustrate the progress of two of the above commands for simplicity.


#### 4.2.4 Create, Read, Update

**Implementation of InitRoomCommand**

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations that `InitRoomCommand` performs.

**Step 1.** The `InitRoomCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it check if the `Integer`defined when instantiating
If it is a positive integer and the number of rooms is more than or equal to the existing number of occupied rooms, InitRoomCommand is valid. 
The checking of the number of rooms is done by `Model#hasSpaceForRooms()`. If this is true then `Integer` is valid, else it is invalid.

**Step 2.** The stated number of rooms is then set to `Integer`, if `Integer` is greater than the existing number of rooms then excess rooms are added to the back of the 
UniqueRoomList. If the number of rooms is less than the `Integer` and there are occupied rooms the information of patients in that room is transferred to an empty room 
in the reduced number of rooms

**Step 4.** A success message with the `Intger` appended with the `InitRoomCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant is displayed on the UI. A new `CommandResult`
returns this message.

**Implementation of AllocateRoomCommand**

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations that `AllocateRoomCommand` performs.

**Step 1.** The `AllocateRoomCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it checks if the `Integer` defined when instantiating
`AllocateRoomCommand(Integer roomNumberToAllocate, AllocateRoomDescriptor AllocateRoomDescriptor)` is valid. This is done using the `Model#getRoomWithRoomNumber` method
 where it is used to get an `Optional<Room>`. If `Optional<Room>` is empty, the `Integer` is not valid.
 The `AllocateRoomDescriptor` holds the information of the `Room` with the patient allocated.

**Step 2.** A new `Room` with the allocated patient will be created and the room is then searched through `RoomList#internalList`
using the `Model#hasRoom(Room room)` method to check if a room with the same room number exists. If it already exists,
`CommandException` will be thrown with an error message.

**Step 3.** The newly created `Room` will replace the existing room object through the `Model#setSingleRoom(Room target, Room editedRoom)`
method.

**Step 4.** A success message with the allocated room will be appended with the `AllocateRoomCommand#MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_ROOM_SUCCESS ` constant. A 
new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

### 4.3 Task Feature

#### 4.3.1 Overview
The task feature in Covigent allows hotel staff to manage and organize time-critical work related to a room in a quarantine facility.
Every room can be allocated any number of tasks, with each task keeping track of the description of the work and a due date by which
it should be completed.

It is important to note that Covigent handles tasks on a per-room basis. Tasks not specific to any room (e.g. tasks related to the operations
of the quarantine facility) are out of scope.

The task feature in Covigent includes the following:

* Adding a task to a room
* Displaying all tasks in the user interface
* Editing the description and due date of a task
* Removing a task from a room
* Filtering tasks based on a criterion and displays the filtered tasks in the user interface (currently on supports filtering by due date)

#### 4.3.2 Implementation
At a higher level, tasks share a composition type relationship with rooms. That is, if a room is deleted, all tasks in that room are similarly deleted.
We have implemented the task feature based on the class diagram in Figure 22.
  <p align="center">
      <img src="images/dg/TaskClassDiagram.png">
      <br />
      <i>Figure 22. Class Diagram for Task</i>
  </p>

Each `Room` contains a `RoomTasks` class, which is a wrapper around `TaskList`.

Task-related operations that alter the tasks in a `Room` must be performed through that `Room`.
The API calls for these operations first proceed to `Room`, which redirects them to `RoomTasks`. To enforce this constraint, `RoomTasks` is not publicly exposed in the API for `Room`
(i.e. there is no getter for `RoomTasks` in `Room`).

`TaskList` emulates the other `List` classes in Covigent such as `UniquePatientList` and `UniqueRoomList`, exposing only an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>`.
This `ObservableList<Task>` is subsequently returned by `RoomTasks` in the `getReadOnlyList()` method to fulfill its contract with the `ReadOnlyList<Task>` interface.

#### 4.3.3 Design Considerations

**Aspect: Retrieving list of tasks from `Room`**

* Option 1: Supplying a getter for `RoomTasks` in `Room`

Having a `getRoomTasks()` method to retrieve all the tasks in `Room` greatly enhances convenience, especially when copying the information from one `Room` to another.
This is because we can use the constructor of `Room` in this manner: `Room copyOfRoom = new Room(..., originalRoom.getRoomTasks()))` (`...` refers to other attributes of `Room` that need to be passed into constructor).
It is a quick way to transfer tasks between `Room`.

However, this option is not optimal from a defensive programming perspective. Because a client can retrieve `RoomTasks` from `Room`, there is potential for abuse.
The `RoomTasks` object may be passed to some other classes that are not `Room`. Consequently, there is no guarantee that a client will not circumvent `Room` and call an operation that changes its tasks such as `addTask(Task)` directly from `RoomTasks`.
This destroys the abstraction barrier of `Room` as clients can modify the tasks in it via external means.

* Option 2: Add a `getReadOnlyTasks()` method in `Room` to retrieve an unmodifiable list of tasks from `RoomTasks`

We chose option 2 for Covigent as we thought it was the safer option. Since `RoomTasks` implements `ReadOnlyList<Task>`, `Room` can retrieve and expose it via a `getReadOnlyTasks()` method for clients to access the tasks.
This is more secure from a defensive programming perspective and respects the abstraction barrier. Without the getter for `RoomTasks`, clients are only allowed to change the tasks in `Room` via its API.
It ensures that the tasks in a `Room` are not modified without knowledge of `Room`, while providing the flexibility for clients to access the information in them.
An additional benefit of this option is that it obscures the fact that `Room` depends on `RoomTasks` for its task-related operations, thus strengthening the composition type relationship between tasks and rooms.

With option 2, the operation for copying tasks from one `Room` to another can be performed as such: `Room copyOfRoom = new Room(..., new RoomTasks(originalRoom.getReadOnlyTasks()))`.
It is probably better for the constructor of `Room` to take in `List<Task>` instead of `RoomTasks` to completely hide the existence of `RoomTasks` from clients.
This can be considered as part of the improvements to be made to Covigent in the future.

A downside of this option is that the implementor (future programmers of Covigent) must be aware of this design decision and avoid exposing `RoomTasks` through the public API of `Room`.
Moreover, there is a slight increase in complexity now that `RoomTasks` has to implement `ReadOnlyList<Task>`.

**Aspect: Storing a list of tasks in `Room`**

* Option 1: Using `List<Task>` in `Room`

This option is simple as it does not require any additional classes. However, `Room` has to handle all task-related operations, which violates the single-responsibility principle. 
Conceptually, we consider `Room` to be a container for a patient and tasks. It should not contain implementations of methods related to patients and tasks.

* Option 2: Using `TaskList` in `Room`

While entirely possible to use `TaskList` to store the tasks in `Room` (see Figure 23), we cannot be certain that `TaskList` will not be used elsewhere in `Covigent` in the future.
  <p align="center">
      <img src="images/dg/TaskAlternativeClassDiagram.png">
      <br />
      <i>Figure 23. Class Diagram for Task using TaskList</i>
  </p>

For instance, suppose we want to support a list of tasks for specific patients (instead of rooms). It may not make much sense to use `TaskList` for both patients and rooms as they can have different behaviors.
Perhaps a maximum of 5 tasks can be assigned to each patient, while there is no limit to the number of tasks that can be assigned to each room.
Taking that into consideration, we decided to add a wrapper class.

* Option 3: Using an extra class in addition to `TaskList`

We chose option 3 and added a new class `RoomTasks` to `Room`. `RoomTasks` is a wrapper around `TaskList` to support room-specific behavior associated with tasks.
A simple example is how we can set a maximum number of tasks each `Room` can hold through `RoomTasks` without modifying `TaskList`. In that sense, option 3 respects the open-closed principle.

An alternative is to use a new class that extends from `TaskList`. This would improve polymorphism as methods that work with `TaskList` will also work with the new class.
However, Liskov substitution principle might be a concern. For instance, if `TaskList` allows an unlimited number of tasks to be stored but `RoomTasks` only allows 500, it would be a violation of Liskov substitution principle.
As such, we did not choose this alternative.

The disadvantage of using another class is the added complexity as API calls for task-related operations need to be routed from the new class to `TaskList`.

#### 4.3.4 Create, Read, Update, Delete
In this section, we will cover the implementation of the manipulation of `Task` data. The commands that allow the task-related operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting of `Task` are `AddTaskCommand`, `ListTaskCommand`, `EditTaskCommand`, and `DeleteTaskCommand` respectively.

The actual manipulation of `Task` data is performed in the `TaskList` class. Some significant methods within `TaskList` that allows the manipulation of `Task` data are shown below:

* `TaskList#add(Task toAdd)` - Adds a `Task` to `TaskList`.
* `TaskList#setTask(Task target, Task editedTask)` - Replaces a `Task` in `TaskList` with the edited `Task`.
* `TaskList#remove(Task toRemove)` - Removes a `Task` from `TaskList`.
* `TaskList#asUnmodifiableObservableList()` - Returns a read-only list containing all `Task` in `TaskList`.
* `RoomTasks#getTaskWithTaskIndex(Index index)` - Returns the `Task` with the `Index` in the `TaskList`. This method is currently in `RoomTasks` but can be safely refactored into `TaskList`.

These methods in `TaskList` class support the corresponding methods in `RoomTasks`. For clients to perform these operations, `Room` exposes `addTask(Task task)`, `setTask(Task task, Task editedTask)`, and `deleteTask(Task task)` in its public API.
Calls to these APIs are redirected to `RoomTasks` and eventually `TaskList`.

Since the commands do not directly interact with `Room` but rather the `Model`, the `Model` interface has to expose `addTaskToRoom(Task task, Room room)`, `deleteTaskFromRoom(Task task, Room room)` and `setTaskToRoom(Task task, Task editedTask, Room room)`.

For brevity's sake, we will only illustrate the implementation of the most complex command, `EditTaskCommand`.

**Implementation of EditTaskCommand**

The following is an explanation of the operations that `EditTaskCommand` performs, with the higher level details (`LogicManager` and `CovigentAppParser`) omitted for simplicity.

**Step 1.** The user executes `edittask [room number] [task index] [other attributes to edit]` command to edit the description of a `Task` in a `Room`. An `EditTaskCommandParser` object is created and the `EditTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called, which helps to parse the different attributes of `Task`. The parse method returns a new `EditTaskCommand` object with the room number, task index, and a descriptor containing the updated values to replace the original.

**Step 2.** The `Room` is retrieved from the list of rooms in Covigent using the `Model#getRoomWithRoomNumber(int roomNumber)` method. If no such `Room` exists, a `CommandException` object will be thrown with an error message.

**Step 3.** The `Task` is retrieved from `RoomTasks` of `Room` using the `Model#getTaskFromRoomWithTaskIndex(Index taskIndex, Room room)` method. If no such `Task` exists, a `CommandException` object will be thrown with an error message.

**Step 4.** The `Task` is edited in `EditTaskCommand` and replaces the original `Task` the room with `Model#setTaskToRoom(Task target, Task editedTask, Room room)`.

**Step 5.** A success message with the new task details will be appended with the `EditTaskCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

The sequence diagram for `EditTaskCommand` can be found below.

#### 4.3.5 Search 

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations that `SearchTaskCommand` performs.

**Step 1.** The `SearchTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it gets information of `task` from each `room` in the `roomList`.

**Step 2.** If the `task` has a `duedate` before the `duedate` from user command, it is stored in `taskListWithDesirableResult`.

**Step 3.** If no `task` is found, `CommandException` will be thrown with an error message. 

**Step 4.** If there is at least one task found, the `model`'s `filteredRoomTaskRecords` is updated with a `dueDatePredicate` using `updateTasksInFilteredRoomTaskRecords`.

**Step 5.** a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

### 4.4 Logging Feature

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See [Section 4.5, "Configuration Features"](#45-configuration-feature))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file

**Logging Levels**:
* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

_Written by Ming De_

### 4.5 Configuration Feature

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Planned Features

This section describes the features planned for the next iteration of Covigent.

### 5.1 Single Command to Create and Allocate Patient to Room

When the user wants to assign a patient to a room, she must run 2 commands: `addpatient` and `allocateroom`. The former creates a new `Patient` object in Covigent and the latter assigns that `Patient` to an empty room.
To improve the user's productivity, we can allow the user to specify a room number when executing `addpatient`. If the room and patient are valid, the patient is added to Covigent and assigned to the room in a single command.

Since these changes will add another layer of complexity, we plan to complete this feature in Covigent v1.5.

### 5.2 Search for Task by Description

The `searchtask` command allows searching for tasks only by due dates. A user with many tasks would most likely want to search for tasks by description.

In addition to modifying `SearchTaskCommand` and `SearchTaskCommandParser`, a new class `DescriptionPredicate` might have to be introduced to filter the tasks by description.
Considering these additional changes, we plan to complete this feature in Covigent v1.5.

### 5.3 Scroll to Modified Task in User Interface

Whenever a user adds or edits a `Patient` or `Room`, the Patients and Rooms tabs in the user interface scrolls to the entry corresponding to the most recent change.
This is useful as the user can immediately review the latest modification on the user interface. To accomplish this, `PatientListPanel` and `RoomListPanel` attach a listener to `ListView<Patient>` and `ListView<Room>` respectively to update the user interface when changes are detected.

Currently, when the user modifies a `Task`, the user interface does not scroll to the latest change. The reason is that the current implementation of the Tasks tab retrieves the room and task details from a `ListView<RoomTaskAssociation>`, as seen in `RoomTaskListPanel`.
The underlying list for `ListView<RoomTaskAssociation>`, found in `RoomTaskRecords` is altered each time there are changes to a room, including not only the tasks but also the room itself and the patient in it.
Hence, the list is unable to distinguish between modifications to tasks, to rooms, or to patients in rooms. Since we do not want the user interface for `Task` to scroll when there are changes to `Room` or `Patient`, we have disabled the listener for `ListView<RoomTaskAssociation>`.

Fixing this issue likely requires a significant overhaul of the implementation of the Tasks tab. We plan to complete this feature in Covigent v2.0.
